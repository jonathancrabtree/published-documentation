The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) is developing an online portal that allows researchers to access and work across multiple Common Fund (CF) program data sets within a digital cloud environment. CF programs generate a wide range of diverse and valuable data sets designed to be used by the research community to accelerate discovery. However, these data sets reside in different locations and it is challenging or even impossible to work with multiple data sets in an accessible and user-friendly way. The CFDE portal helps to remedy this problem by creating a shared resource that makes CF data sets FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and enables researchers to ask scientific and clinical questions from a single access point.

The CFDE Coordinating Center oversees CFDE activities and works closely with participating CF data coordinating centers (DCCs) to include an initial set of CF data sets, with plans to expand to additional data sets in the future. The CFDE portal will also develop and deploy a number of resources and tools, including training materials that will be created to empower the research community to use CF data sets for novel scientific research that was not possible before. This may include hypothesis generation, discovery, or validation that leads to new insights in health and disease.

# Welcome to the Documentation for the CFDE

The goal of Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) is to federate data from Common Fund Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) to improve access to data derived from hundreds of studies and samples collected from thousands of human subjects. This project involves a diversity of datatypes has been generated at the genomic, expression, proteomic, metagenomic, and imaging levels, and the DCCs support a tremendous range of scientific discovery efforts.
To facilitate this task, the CFDE has developed and refined software tools. To view documentation for these tools, please select from the following:

- The [Crosscut Metadata Model](./c2m2/draft-C2M2_specification/README.md) (C2M2) documentation provides a flexible standard for describing biomedical experimental data.
- The [Datapackage Submission System](./cfde-submit/docs/index.md) documentation describes how Common Fund metadata is submitted to the [CFDE Search Portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/). For help with submissions, you can also check the [wiki](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki), search common errors in the [discussion board](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/discussions), or read the [CFDE Portal User Guide](./about/portalguide/). 
- The [FAIR cookbook](./the-fair-cookbook/intro.md) provides introductory materials about various aspects of FAIRness, including practical guides that show how to enhance digital objects by adhering them to community accepted standards.
